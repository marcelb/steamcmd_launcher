# steamcmd_launcher
couple of bashscripts who help in running multiple steam game servers. 

this was created for barotrauma and it does not have any barotrauma specifics in it.
you should be able to adapt it to anything.

it expects steamcmd.sh in ~/Steam and all further game dependencies of the game installed already.

you also need to configure some vars in server.sh
