# steamcmd_launcher
couple of bashscripts who help in running multiple steam game servers. 

this was created for barotrauma and it does have a lot of barotrauma specifics in it, but you should be able to adapt it to anything.

it expects steamcmd.sh in ~/Steam and all mono dependencies of the game installed.

you also need to configure some vars in baroserver.sh
